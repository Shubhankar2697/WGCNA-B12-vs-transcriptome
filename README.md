Project Description
Maternal deficiency of vitamin B12 (B12) is associated with neural tube defects (NTDs), fetal growth restriction, and future risk of non-communicable disease in the offspring. Little is known about the molecular basis of these associations. We investigated the association of vitamin B12 levels and other micronutrient levels in the cord-blood with gene expression in the cord blood mononuclear cells.
A Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was performed on cord blood transcriptome of babies born in a pre-conceptional trial of vitamin B12 and multi-micronutrients (MMN). The modules that showed strong correlation with cord blood vitamin B12 levels were subjected for gene enrichment analysis to understand their function.
 Steps for analysis 
 1. Load the R script in R studio (v4.1.2 suitable for WGCNA) and download the clinical and transcriptomic data provided in csv format.
 2. Before Running the script, install packages provided in the script for the analysis.
 3. A csv file with median valuse and range of the required clinical data is also provided for carrying of the analysis.
